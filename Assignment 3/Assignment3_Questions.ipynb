    "The learning algorithm is a set of instructions that allows a computer program to imitate the way a human gets better at characterizing some types of information. The main objective of learning algorithm is to enable system to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It tries to train the model such that we can predict future outcomes in a way. The algorithm considers all the variables it has been exposed to during its training and finds the best combination of these variables to solve a problem. This unique combination of variables is ‘learned’ by the machine through trial and error. The purpose of  learning Algorithms  is to discover patterns in your data and then make predictions based on often complex patterns to answer business questions, detect and analyse trends and help solve problems."

As a result, we can encode 0 as -0.5 and 1 as 0.5. So, negative weights are also considered. However, in a real-world scenario, this would be very computationally heavy."

    "In STDP learning rule, there is a weight change if there is a pre-synaptic spike in the temporal vicinity of a post-synaptic spike. If the pre-synaptic spike occurs immediately before the post-synaptic spike, then the change is positive. Otherwise, the change is negative. Basically, our interest lies in the temporal range only which induces a change in the synaptic weights. In our network, each connection between the two neurons is associated with a delay of time units, which is the time difference between the post-synaptic firing time and the time the pre-synaptic potential starts rising. Since the model is envisioned to be used in digital systems, time is counted in discrete units. The membrane potential is described as a function of time and is increased by a synaptic weight value for each incoming spike. A constant value is subtracted from the membrane potential at every time instant to take into account the delay of time units. When the membrane potential crosses the threshold potential, the neuron produces a spike and the membrane potential decreases to the resting potential, which is the minimum potential level of a neuron."
